            <h2>What is Cyclone Intensity Prediction?</h2>
            <p>Cyclone intensity prediction is the application of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to forecast the strength and severity of cyclones. It plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness and risk mitigation efforts by providing timely and accurate information to authorities and communities.</p>
            <h2>How Does Cyclone Intensity Prediction Work?</h2>
            <p>Cyclone intensity prediction algorithms utilize vast datasets of historical cyclone data and meteorological parameters such as sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and humidity. Deep learning models are trained to analyze these complex patterns and relationships, enabling accurate predictions of cyclone intensity and trajectory.</p>
            <h2>Applications of Cyclone Intensity Prediction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Disaster preparedness: Providing early warnings and evacuation advisories to vulnerable communities.</li>
                <li>Emergency response planning: Assisting authorities in allocating resources and coordinating relief efforts.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure protection: Minimizing damage to critical infrastructure such as buildings, roads, and power lines.</li>
                <li>Environmental monitoring: Studying the impact of cyclones on ecosystems and climate patterns.</li>
            </ul>
